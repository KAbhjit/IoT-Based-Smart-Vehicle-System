# IoT-Based-Smart-Vehicle-System
Problem Statement: 
Driving under the influence of alcohol and drowsiness are leading causes of road accidents globally. Despite strict regulations and awareness efforts, accidents due to impaired or fatigued driving continue to pose serious risks to both drivers and pedestrians. Current detection methods are often limited in scope, relying heavily on manual monitoring or reactive measures after an incident has occurred, which are insufficient for effective real-time prevention. 
This project aims to develop an IoT and image processing-based detection system to monitor and alert for signs of alcohol consumption and drowsiness in drivers in real-time. By integrating sensors and cameras within the vehicle, the system will detect alcohol levels and analyze facial features to identify signs of sleepiness or fatigue. The system will then generate alerts or take preventive actions, such as activating alarms, to avoid potential accidents. This solution seeks to enhance road safety by offering an automated, real-time response system that proactively prevents accidents related to alcohol impairment and drowsy driving. 
 
Highlights 
 
Water Sprinkler System for Drowsiness Detection: The system activates a water sprinkler to refresh the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected, aiming to maintain alertness and prevent accidents. 
 
Self-Parking in Alcohol Detection: When alcohol levels exceed the set threshold, the system restricts vehicle control and initiates self-parking to safely immobilize the vehicle, ensuring the driver's and others' safety. 
Comprehensive Driver Assessment: Monitors both alcohol consumption and signs of fatigue, providing a holistic approach to driver safety. 
 
Cost-Effective Solution: Utilizes affordable sensors and microcontrollers, making the system accessible for a wide range of vehicles without high costs. 
 
Scalable Design: Easily adapts to various vehicle types and can be integrated with existing vehicle systems for enhanced functionality and safety. 
 
Abstract 
 
    Driving under the influence of alcohol and driver fatigue are major factors contributing to road accidents worldwide, posing critical risks to both drivers and pedestrians. Despite stringent regulations and extensive public awareness campaigns, impaired and fatigued driving remain pressing safety issues due to a lack of reliable, real-time detection and intervention systems. Many current detection approaches are constrained by their reliance on post-incident analysis or manual monitoring methods, which do not address the need for immediate preventive action. 
This study introduces an IoT- and image processing-based system designed to detect alcohol consumption and drowsiness in drivers in real-time. Leveraging the combined capabilities of alcohol sensors and in-car cameras, the system assesses the driver's breath alcohol content and analyzes facial features to identify signs of drowsiness. Once impairment or fatigue indicators are detected, the system initiates alerts or other preventive measures, such as activating in-vehicle alarms or restricting vehicle controls, aimed at reducing the likelihood of accidents. 
 
 Existing methods with results 
 
Numerous systems have been explored for addressing alcohol and drowsiness detection in vehicles. Conventional systems rely heavily on manual checks or breathalyzer devices to measure blood alcohol content (BAC) levels, often as part of roadside checks or pre-ignition interlocks. These systems, however, are typically reactive and limited to alcohol detection, with minimal attention given to driver fatigue. Drowsiness detection technologies often employ blink rate monitoring or head-tilt sensors, but they lack robustness in varying light conditions and frequently result in high false-positive rates. 
Recent advancements have led to the implementation of wearable technologies, such as smart bands or EEG-based systems, to assess fatigue by measuring physiological signals. While they can improve drowsiness detection accuracy, their application in vehicles is constrained by the need for the driver to wear specific devices, potentially affecting comfort and usability. Field trials and studies on these traditional methods show limited effectiveness in real-time scenarios, with response times lagging behind the actual onset of impairment or fatigue. 
 
 Proposed methods with results 
The proposed system overcomes these limitations by integrating IoT and image processing technologies for a seamless, real-time monitoring solution. Alcohol detection sensors embedded within the vehicle continuously analyze ambient air for traces of alcohol, triggering alerts if BAC levels exceed the safe threshold. In parallel, the image processing component uses in-cabin 
 
cameras to capture and process the driver’s facial expressions and eye patterns, identifying signs of drowsiness such as prolonged eye closure and reduced blink rates. 
A machine learning model is employed to enhance detection accuracy by analyzing the driver’s baseline behavior and adapting to changing conditions, such as lighting variations and individual differences. Testing across various driving scenarios has shown promising results, with the system effectively detecting alcohol and fatigue indicators at a faster response rate compared to existing methods. This integrated approach offers a proactive solution, reducing accident risk by enabling real-time, automated interventions and enhancing overall road safety for drivers and pedestrians alike.
